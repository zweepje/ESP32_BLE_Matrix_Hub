# ESP32-iPixel

**ESP32-iPixel** is a project to control **iPixel color matrices** using an ESP32 microcontroller.  
It exposes the device’s functionality via a **REST API** served by a built-in web server.

> [!CAUTION]  
> This docuementation is outdated as a rewrite of the webserver is going on!

# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ UNSTABLE
This is currently only work-in-progress with the only supported device beeing the ESP32-S3 (SuperMicro).  
Support for further ESP32 boards is planned.

## 📡 Endpoints
All endpoints are **device-specific**, identified by `:mac` (the device's MAC address).  
You have to determine this BLE-address on your own (e.g. using Android Apps).  

> ⚠️ When an endpoint is called for the first time, the ESP32 connects to the device.  
> This may temporarily return **HTTP 408 (Request Timeout)**.

## 🖼️ GFX
**ESP32-iPixel** features a very early stage GFX stack that allows rendering element-based views on the device by sending the structure via JSON.  
Take a look at the example in [GFX.md](GFX.md)


## ⚙️ Installation
1. Install **[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)**.
2. Build and upload the firmware to the ESP32 using PlatformIO.
3. Open a **Chromium-based browser** and visit [https://install.wled.me/](https://install.wled.me/).
4. Click **Install** and select your device.
5. Connect to WiFi:
   * Click **Connect to WiFi** and wait for the scan to finish.
   * Select your WiFi network and enter credentials.
   * Wait for the connection to establish.
6. Click **Visit Device** to get the IP address.

## 📝 Todo
* Support `sendText` for other matrices than 96x16
* Device pairings (save devices instead of always using the mac)
* Password or key-based protection
* Connection improvements (faster connect? better disconnect handling?)
* Clock Mode via NTP (set Display as clock)
* Web Flasher Support
